# Design & Analysis Of Algorithm Exercises 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Structure & Algorithm Exercises** repository! This space is dedicated to solving and experimenting with **Dynamic Programming** and **Divide-and-Conquer** algorithms in C++.

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains various algorithm implementations and problem-solving approaches, focusing on:
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** – Optimized solutions using memoization & tabulation techniques.
- **Divide-and-Conquer** – Recursive problem breakdown for efficient computation.
- **Algorithm Complexity Analysis** – Understanding runtime efficiency.

## 🔍 Implemented Algorithms
### **Dynamic Programming**
- Fibonacci Sequence (Top-Down & Bottom-Up)
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Knapsack Problem (0/1 Knapsack)
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Coin Change Problem

### **Divide-and-Conquer**
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Closest Pair of Points Problem
- Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication
